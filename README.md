# SharpADBNative
Android Device Bridge Native implementation in c#

There are a lot of ADB implementations in .Net, but all of them are a wrapper of adb.exe.
Here is the native C# implementation for ADB

##### Plan:
* 1st Step: import from oringial AdbWinApi.dll & AdbWinUsbApi.dll
* 2nd Step: replace AdbWinApi with c# native code
* 3rd Step: replace AdbWinUsbApi with c# native code

Now the 1st step is still WIP.
